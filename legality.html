        <h1> Duplication Legality</h1>
        <p>The protection of software started after it was realized that plagiarists could Escape copyright
            infringement through immaterial forms of theft. This was remedied by the passage of the Copyright Acts of
            1976 and the adjustments made in 1980 by CONTU (The Congressional Commission on New Technological Uses on
            Copyrighted Works).

            Non-literal forms of infringement are different from direct infringement in that they mimic a concept
            rather than the actual language. <img src="legality.jpg" alt="Legality">Non-literal infringement was still
            present in the 1900s and courts were tasked with distinguish between idea and expression. However, software
            duplication is typically literal due to it being functional rather than showy. In 1978 it was decided that
            software wouldn’t be protected from non-literal infringement because the arrangement and combination is the
            also the intellectual property involved.

            Copyright isn’t an international law, it is often said that owning an idea is a very western idea, and thus
            isn’t enforced in many Asian countries. Software piracy in Taiwan alone resulted in a loss of 756 million
            dollars to the U.S. for software piracy in 1990. In the same year the U.S. software industry lost 400
            million dollars to China for software piracy.
