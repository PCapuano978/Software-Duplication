        <h1>Protection</h1>
        <p>In software protection it is often necessary to hide important things in your code. There are two main part
            of the software protection system the first is something that must be difficult to reproduce, unique some
            might say. This unique attribute is normally achieved by using a Hardware Security Device (HSD)or a floppy
            disk.Unfortunately this protection is simple and can easily be beaten by copying the unique systems
            signature. In order to defend against this organizations try to make the HSD as hard to copy as possible. A
            way to protect the unique source ,if it is a floppy disc, is to laser a small part of the magnetic material
            that makes the floppy disc what it is. This works because the software will send a mark to the damaged area
            then reads the info from the damaged area. If someone copied the original floppy disc then the info that
            the software read would be different and would then be identified as a copy. However, you have to be
            careful when lazer the floppy disc because if you damage the wrong part then the disc will send back errors
            that will stop it from working. If you are able then use a HSD then do so as it is a lot better at hiding
            the unique signature but it is a lot more expensive. No matter how good your unique signature is hidden or
            how unique it if the second part of the software protection is weak then they can just hack through that.</p>

        <p> The second part of the software protection is a piece of software that checks up on the HSD. This software
            can find out if the HSD is working or has been tampered with. Unfortunately this protection is simple as
            well and can easily be beaten by changing the softwares code to work without the unique signature. In order
            to defend against this organizations try to make the software hard to modify. One way to protect the
            software portion of the protection is to install sensor software to determine if the operating environment
            has changed and if it has then the sensor software can display a unauthorized duplicate message.
            Unfortunately there is software that can avoid altering the operating environment in ways that can be
            detected. This allows hackers to try and duplicate code without detection and even if they are detected
            then nothing bad happens to the hacker and they can just try again. This means that most hackers would have
            infinite tries to duplicate code. A way to halt a hackers progress is to use Technology Denial Concepts or
            TDC. No matter how many protections and sensors you have without TDC then the hacker will win. The TDCâ€™s
            are a form of punishment for being detected by a sensor. This punishment can be many things including but
            not limited to destroying critical systems components which would make it impossible to continue to test
            using the system that was destroyed and slightly altering the system to misinform the hacker. </p>

        <p>In conclusion it takes many different parts of equal strength to protect software from duplication.
